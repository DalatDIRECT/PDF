# PDF
All about inserting Images, Text, Audio and Video into PDFs.
The website I am working has alot of information. I can create PDF without any problems and insert onto my Landing Page. The PDF books contain information on only one subject (can combine many together if wanted). I have PDF Embedder Pro which I use. I can remember reading somewhere that you could modify the CSS to include   shelf    . This is what I'm looking for so that I can put a bookshelf on my Landing Page. Much like a library. Tghey read only the PDF Book that they are interested in
